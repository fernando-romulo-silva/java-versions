# Project status

I use this project to learn new technologies related to Java.<br />
I change this project constantly improving and adding new examples, click [here](docs/STATUS.md) to follow up.

# The Problem

Java language has a ton of versions, each version version with new features, libraries, tools, etc. <br />
How can I be in the know all this stuff? I still have a life!

# About

A simple test-new-features application, since I am a Java developer, this project helps me keep up with new features of this language.<br />
The examples are simple although most of them are running and you can see the result. <br />
My focus here is ONLY final features, and preview features are ignored.
